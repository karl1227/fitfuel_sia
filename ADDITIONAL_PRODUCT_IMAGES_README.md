# Additional Product Images Feature

## Overview
This feature allows products in the FitFuel e-commerce system to have up to 3 additional images beyond the main product image. It includes both admin panel management and customer-facing display functionality.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Database Changes
- **New Table**: `product_images`
  - `id` (PK, auto-increment)
  - `product_id` (FK → products.id)
  - `image_path` (VARCHAR, file path to stored image)
  - `created_at` (timestamp)

### 2. Admin Panel Features
- **File Upload Interface**: Up to 3 additional images per product
- **Drag & Drop Support**: Users can drag and drop image files
- **File Validation**: 
  - Allowed formats: JPG, JPEG, PNG, GIF, WebP
  - Maximum file size: 2MB per image
  - Maximum count: 3 additional images
- **Image Preview**: Real-time preview of uploaded images
- **Image Management**: 
  - Remove images before saving
  - Replace existing images
  - Delete images from existing products
- **Form Validation**: Client-side and server-side validation

### 3. Customer-Facing Features
- **Product Detail Page**: New dedicated page (`product_detail.php`)
- **Image Gallery**: 
  - Main image display
  - Thumbnail navigation
  - Smooth image switching
- **Shop Page Integration**:
  - Visual indicator showing number of additional images
  - Clickable product cards linking to detail page
  - Hover effects and transitions

### 4. Backend Processing
- **File Upload Handling**: Secure file upload with validation
- **Image Storage**: Files stored in `/uploads/products/` directory
- **Database Operations**: CRUD operations for product images
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling and user feedback

### 5. Audit Trail Integration
- **Logging Actions**:
  - "Added product images (X)"
  - "Deleted product image (ID: X)"
  - "Updated product images for Product #X"
- **Detailed Tracking**: Includes image counts, file paths, and operation results

## File Structure

### New Files
- `product_detail.php` - Customer-facing product detail page
- `database_updates.sql` - SQL script to create product_images table
- `update_database.php` - PHP script to run database updates

### Modified Files
- `admin/product.php` - Updated with additional image functionality
- `shop.php` - Enhanced with product detail links and image indicators

## Installation Instructions

### 1. Database Setup
Run the database update script:
```bash
php update_database.php
```
Or manually execute the SQL in `database_updates.sql`:
```sql
CREATE TABLE `product_images` (
  `id` bigint(20) UNSIGNED NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  `product_id` bigint(20) UNSIGNED NOT NULL,
  `image_path` varchar(255) NOT NULL,
  `created_at` timestamp NOT NULL DEFAULT current_timestamp(),
  PRIMARY KEY (`id`),
  KEY `product_id` (`product_id`),
  CONSTRAINT `product_images_ibfk_1` FOREIGN KEY (`product_id`) REFERENCES `products` (`product_id`) ON DELETE CASCADE
) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8mb4 COLLATE=utf8mb4_general_ci;
```

### 2. File Permissions
Ensure the uploads directory has proper permissions:
```bash
chmod 755 uploads/products/
```

### 3. Configuration
No additional configuration required. The feature uses existing database and upload configurations.

## Usage Guide

### For Administrators

#### Adding Additional Images to New Products
1. Go to Admin Panel → Products → Add Product
2. Upload main product image (existing functionality)
3. In "Additional Product Images" section:
   - Click "Choose Additional Images" or drag & drop files
   - Select up to 3 image files (max 2MB each)
   - Preview images before saving
   - Remove unwanted images using the X button
4. Save the product

#### Managing Existing Product Images
1. Go to Admin Panel → Products → Edit Product
2. View existing additional images
3. To add more images:
   - Upload new files (respecting the 3-image limit)
4. To remove images:
   - Click the X button on existing images
5. Save changes

### For Customers

#### Viewing Product Images
1. Browse products in the Shop page
2. Products with additional images show a blue badge with image count
3. Click on product image or name to view full details
4. On product detail page:
   - Main image displays prominently
   - Thumbnail gallery below main image
   - Click thumbnails to switch main image view

## Technical Details

### File Upload Process
1. Client-side validation (file type, size, count)
2. Server-side validation and sanitization
3. Unique filename generation (uniqid + timestamp)
4. Secure file storage in uploads directory
5. Database record creation

### Image Display Logic
- Main image: First image from products.images JSON field
- Additional images: Retrieved from product_images table
- Fallback: Placeholder image if no images available

### Security Considerations
- File type validation (whitelist approach)
- File size limits (2MB per image)
- Secure filename generation
- Upload directory permissions
- SQL injection prevention (PDO prepared statements)

## API Endpoints

### Product Detail Page
- **URL**: `product_detail.php?id={product_id}`
- **Method**: GET
- **Parameters**: 
  - `id` (required) - Product ID

### Admin Product Management
- **URL**: `admin/product.php`
- **Method**: POST
- **Actions**: 
  - `add` - Create new product with images
  - `edit` - Update existing product and images
  - `delete` - Remove product (cascades to images)

## Browser Compatibility
- Modern browsers with HTML5 File API support
- Drag & drop functionality works in:
  - Chrome 13+
  - Firefox 3.6+
  - Safari 6+
  - Edge 12+

## Performance Considerations
- Images are served directly from file system
- Thumbnail generation could be added for optimization
- Database queries optimized with proper indexing
- Lazy loading could be implemented for large image galleries

## Future Enhancements
- Image resizing and optimization
- Multiple image formats support (WebP, AVIF)
- Image alt text management
- Bulk image upload
- Image sorting/reordering
- Advanced image gallery with zoom/lightbox
- Image compression on upload

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Upload fails**: Check file permissions on uploads directory
2. **Images not displaying**: Verify image paths and file existence
3. **Database errors**: Ensure product_images table exists
4. **File size errors**: Check PHP upload limits (upload_max_filesize, post_max_size)

### Debug Mode
Enable error reporting in PHP for debugging:
```php
ini_set('display_errors', 1);
error_reporting(E_ALL);
```
